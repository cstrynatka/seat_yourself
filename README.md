# seat_yourself
We were assigned a group project to create an app imitating Open Table, a site that allows users to make restaurant reservations online.

Some of the biggest challenges we faced were inputting the right Ruby code into the Models, Views and Controllers, and ensuring each one linked to each other properly. We also took special care to ensure the Sessions section made user use secure.
